            <ul>

                <li>It is much better to get a head start on assignments than it is to wait for the due date. Doing a bit of
                    work everyday can make a project much more managable.</li>
                <li>If you are really worried about asynchronous learning, see if your school offers hybrid classes. These are
                    usually half online, half in person.</li>
                <li>Online schooling can actually open up your work schedule, as your work is more flexibile you are able to plan around school better.</li>
